## Deluge is now using its own internal copy of rb_libtorrent, which they have
## heavily modified. Patches were sent to the upstream rb_libtorrent devs,
## and Deluge frequently re-syncs with the upstream rb_libtorrent codebase.
## Their reason for this is that there is no rasterbar-libtorrent package in
## neither Debian nor its derivatives such as Ubuntu, so they do this to make
## make it simpler to package...on Debian. @_@
## However, as of this time, it does not build against a system copy of 0.12
## or a 0.13 nightly snapshot, so this is the only way to make this software
## functional. (See also: README.Packagers in the root of the source tarball.)

%description
Deluge is a new BitTorrent client, created using Python and GTK+. It is
intended to bring a native, full-featured client to Linux GTK+ desktop
environments such as GNOME and XFCE. It supports features such as DHT
(Distributed Hash Tables), PEX (ÂµTorrent-compatible Peer Exchange), and UPnP
(Universal Plug-n-Play) that allow one to more easily share BitTorrent data
even from behind a router with virtually zero configuration of port-forwarding.
